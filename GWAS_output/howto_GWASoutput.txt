Process GWAS output: select SNPs, create plots, calculate lambda
================================================================

These scripts process the output of a GWAS run on multiple phenotypes. They select SNPs based on QC criteria (MAF,
R2T, p-value cutoff for significant SNPs) and calculate the lambda inflation factor on the selected set. The 
selected sets per phenotype can be automatedly fed to the plot script described in plots_large_sets/howto_gnuplot.txt
paragraph 'b' to create manhattan and qq plots.

Step 1: Select and lambda; selectsign_qc_assoc_output_lambda_parallel.py
Takes the qt_assoc (or cc_assoc using selectsign_qc_ccassoc_output_lambda_parallel.py) output and creates 3 output files:
1. <infile>-sorted	all SNPs with R2T and MAF above the criteria
2. <infile>_lambda.txt	lambda inflation factor
3. <infile>_selected_pval1e-6.txt	all SNPs with R2T and MAF above the criteria and p-value below cutoff; sorted by p-value
The criteria and cutoff can be set in lines 16-18 of the script. Current settings: MAF>1%, R2T>40%, p-value<1e-6.
Running this script can be automated for multiple phenotypes using run_select_old.sh (for the 'old' pipeline) or 
run_select.sh (for the new pipeline running multiple phenotypes per job; creates different output directories).

Step 2: concatenate output step 1; join_selected_lambdas.py
This script puts the output of step 1 for all phenotypes in two files: one for the lambdas and one for the selected
significant SNPs. Output file names can be set in lines 5 and 6.

Step 3: create plots; manhattan_epacts_old.sh or manhattan_epacts.sh
Automates creating manhattan and qq plots using epacts-plot2 for multiple phenotypes ran by the old or new pipeline
respectively.
